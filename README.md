# Lettuce Go
### The prototype for the app [Let's Go](https://do-stuff-find-people.appspot.com), an app for finding new friends.

###### Currently, a small team of developers is working on finalizing the app and getting it to the MVP. If you are interested in contributing, here's how:

1. Fork this repo, then clone your fork

We are using [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). If you are not familiar with these two frameworks then it will definitly help to get used to them. The project is also based off of [Monica Dinculescu's](https://github.com/notwaldorf) app [Mojibrag](https://mojibrag.firebaseapp.com/?lang=en). You can see her talk about how it works [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t2JRKTCYbI). Once you are familiar with how the app functions.
2. Open and terminal and navigate to this directory
3. Run `bower install` to get the dependencies
3. Install the Polymer CLI if you haven't already
4. Run `polymer serve`
5. Go to your `localhost:8080` in your browser
6. Get coding!
